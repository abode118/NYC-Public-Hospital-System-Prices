# NYC-Public-Hospital-System-Prices

The NYC public hospital system has published prices for all of their procedures at all of their facilities. In this data, there is the list price, discounted cash price, and the negotiated price for a number of insurance plans (though not all plans, it appears).

You can download the files [here](https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/paying-for-your-health-care/your-healthcare-costs/facility-charges/). However, we will pull the files automatically in the code.

In this project we will look at:
1. List price vs. cash price vs. negotiated price per procedure (within the same hospital)
2. List price and cash price for the same procedure across the different hospitals within the NYC public hospital system
